       As we already know, some people are cruel and judge people off limited information. Some of those people are cops, and things get out of control. 
       But something you might not know is that when us humans work together, our world is as stronger that ever. Even though it is still sad knowing some 
       people treat others differently, it is reassuring to know that others also care for us and will fight for our rights
