What is police brutality 
</h1>
<h3 id="para">
    Police brutality is when the law enforcement is prejudicial(To judge someone off limited information) and uses their badge as an advantage 
    of hurting innocent civilians or. Some ways police could show police brutality could be arresting the wrong person, based on something they 
    may not like, for example, skin colour, gender and money wise. They also could use weapons that aren't meant to go in contact with innocent 
    people like tasers, a glock firearm or a baton. But using these stuff on good people is against everything they stand for, and are breaking \
    he oath they took to serve and protect us.
